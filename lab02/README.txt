My index.html and styles.css are both authentic work done by me and my brain.
In index.js I used one resource. https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/javascript-tutorial/calculator-in-javascript
This site helped me with display, solve, and clearScreen functions.
Display and clearScreen are the same code done by the website. However, it is really simple code.

For my solve function I copied some of it but made it into my own.
I added if cases and also changed parts of the code to match the bonus work.

All bonus work was done by myself and my brain.
