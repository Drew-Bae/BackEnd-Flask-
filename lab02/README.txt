My index.html and styles.css are both authentic work done by me and my brain.
In index.js I used one resource. https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/javascript-tutorial/calculator-in-javascript
This site helped me with display, solve, and clearScreen functions.
Display and clearScreen are the same code done by the website. However, it is really simple code.

For my solve function I copied some of it but made it into my own.
I added if cases and also changed parts of the code to match the bonus work.

All bonus work was done by myself and my brain.

#1 sin, cos, tan =
To run this you first type in the sin, cos, or tan button then a number.
Then click the equal sign to compute.
This will output the correct answer.

#2 squar root =
To run this you first type the squar root button then a number.
Then click the equal sign to compute.
This will output the correct answer.

#3 power =
To run this you first put in the base numbers, then the power sign, and finally the exponent number('s)
Then click the equal sign to compute.
This will output the correct answer.

#4 +, -, *, / =
To run this you put the first few numbers you want to compute then the symbol then the other numbers.
Click the equal sign to compute.
This will output the correct answer.

#5 . =
Added decimals as well.
